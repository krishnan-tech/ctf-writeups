#  [Day 25] Challenge-less

## Description
To everyone who participated in our Advent of Cyber event, we hope you learnt something new! There is no challenge on the last day, instead we ask you complete a room on TryHackMe and enjoy some time off on Christmas day!

We will pick the daily prize winners and the main winners on Sunday, so there is still time to complete challenges and enter yourself!
