Hi Lindsey here. I've been a great Elf all year, but there was one incident and now I think I'm on Santa's naughty list.

What? You didn't think us elves got presents too? Well we do and we get first pick of the pressies!

Can you help me hack into Santa's system that keeps track of the naughty and nice people to see if I am on it?

Check out the blog post shown above to help you on this task.
